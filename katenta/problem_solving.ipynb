    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "A company wants to develop a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System** that manages customer data, tracks sales, and generates reports. The system should be designed using modular programming principles, where different functionalities are separated into distinct modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Modules:\n",
    "1. **Customer Management Module**  \n",
    "   - Stores customer details (name, email, phone).  \n",
    "   - Allows adding, updating, and deleting customer records.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sales Tracking Module**  \n",
    "   - Records sales transactions (customer, product, amount).  \n",
    "   - Tracks revenue and sales trends over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reporting Module**  \n",
    "   - Generates reports based on customer interactions and sales data.  \n",
    "   - Provides insights into customer behavior and sales performance.  \n"
